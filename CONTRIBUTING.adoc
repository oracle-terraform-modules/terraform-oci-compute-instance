Oracle welcomes contributions to this repository from anyone.

If you want to submit a pull request to fix a bug or enhance an existing feature, please first open an issue and link to that issue when you submit your pull request.

If you have any questions about a possible submission, feel free to open an issue too.

== Coding conventions

Be sure to check xref:docs/codingconventions.adoc[the coding conventions] of this project before starting to develop.

== Required documentation updates

The documentation for your contribution is as valuable as the code you contribute.

Please ensure the documentation is updated to include any new feature, functionality or fix you contribute. Including documentation changes will make the contribution process far quicker and easier (and the maintainers will love you!).

You should ensure that your documentation changes include the following:

* Update xref:CHANGELOG.adoc[CHANGELOG] under the 'Unreleased' section. The maintainers will include this to the appropriate version section during the release process for that version
* If your contribution provision new resources, update the README introduction section
* Add your GitHub handler to xref:CONTRIBUTORS.adoc[CONTRIBUTORS] under the *CONTRIBUTORS* section
* Don't forget how important the documentation is, especially for examples: we would love it if you updated the `main.tf` and `variables.tf` in the `examples/` folder. A simple example is fine.
* You should also update the code examples in link:examples/README.md[examples/README]: it contains sample code blocks that probably needs to be updated to reflect your changes

NOTE: Tables on xref:docs/terraformoptions.adoc[docs/terraformoptions] are automatically generated using terraform-docs. The maintainer will refesh this document before release, but variables must be defined as described in xref:doc/codingconventions.adoc[docs/codingconventions].

* Ensure that any documentation is updated with the changes that are required by your fix.
